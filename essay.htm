	<h2>The Search Into Colorblindness</h2>
	<p>Connor Hoffmann<br>Jamie Shrewbury<br>Eng 105<br>September 25, 2017</p>
	<h>Abstract</h><br>
</div>
	<p2>Colorblindness, to start off this research paper what do I know and what I want to find out? Well, I’m colorblind; and I want to know more about it. I have been colorblind my entire life and it has affected me in interesting ways. To me, it's really interesting that I can’t see certain colors. Throughout my life, because of colorblindness, many things have happened to me that seem unusual. One unusual thing that happened was in chemistry class. I had to use my partner in my lab to tell me what color the flame was as we burned salts. Little things like that have made me get used to being colorblind and have led me to accept it which brings me to the point. What do I know about colorblindness?</p2>
	<p>I know it's probably genetic, I know my grandpa is colorblind, I know my cousin is colorblind, I know there are different types of color blindness even though my grandpa and cousin mix up the same colors. I know that if you want to become a pilot you can't because they want the pilot to know what colors the runways are if you're flying and landing at different airports. Unfortunately, if your lifelong goal was to be a pilot and you’re colorblind then, sorry. So why me? Why am I colorblind, what is really causing me to be colorblind? What I want to find out about color blindness is really how it happens, what is working in the body and the eyes and what causes it to happen. Basically I want to know the science behind it. For the most part science is pretty interesting to me and I think that knowing about the science aspects of colorblindness would be good to know because I am colorblind myself. I also want to find out if color blindness can be cured, is there any way to permanently solve it? I do know that they sell glasses that are supposed to make you see colors and I've actually tried a pair but they weren't my type of color blindness so I couldn't really see much of a difference. Are there other ways rather than glasses?  Are there surgical procedures that have been done to try to fix colorblindness? Have scientists been able to test people to determine if they can be fixed? Have there been any attempts to re-create colorblindness in someone that's not colorblind? Have there been any points in history where someone who is colorblind magically starts seeing color? Can humans grow out of colorblindness? As you can see I have many questions about colorblindness and I feel it will be difficult to answer all of them. So, I will focus on the question that intrigues me the most. Scientifically, what is colorblindness?</p>
<div class="cen">	
<h>Research</h>
</div>
	<p>To start off my research I found an article by Lindsey T. Sharp that was edited by Karl R. Gegenfurtner. It is a very scientific article which explains various complex aspects of the vision in humans and how the science behind it works. According to the authors, normal color vision (trichromacy) can vary significantly among males and females, in large part the diversity is due to individual differences in the optical pigments. Not everyone is blessed with color vision many people are partially colorblind or completely color blind. Apparently a very small amount of people are completely color blind and unable to discriminate color at all. This is the least common type of color blindness and I will not be covering this as much because I am only partially color blind.</p>
	<p>What does it mean to be partially colorblind? Partially colorblind people have trouble recognizing color differences that a trichromat (person who can see color) can distinguish easily [1]. The most common forms of colorblindness, also known as color vision deficiencies, are inherited. These inherited traits arise from alterations in the genes. There are three types of color pigment cones within the eye and because of inherited genes people can have altered cones; which causes partial colorblindness, or even be missing cones, which will cause them to see one less color-dimension per cone. The first type of colorblindness is called anomalous trichromacy, anomalous trichromacy is when one of the three colored pigments are altered but the vision is not fully impaired [1] (partial colorblindness) , the next one is dichromacy. Dichromacy is when one of the three cone pigments are missing and color vision is reduced to two dimensions [1]. The last one is Monochromacy and that is when two or all three of the cone pigments are missing and color is reduced to one dimension [1]. Under special conditions color vision maybe in some respects tetra-chromatic, this is when an extra cone pigment is present due to an X-chromosome. So, in other words you can have an extra cone pigment which might enhance your color vision.</p>
	<p>The first cone pigment deficiency I talked about which is, anomalous trichromacy; where one cone is altered is the most common type of colorblindness. This is the type of colorblindness I believe I have. Interestingly this type of colorblindness has different types within it. These inherited alterations which affect a single cone pigment are referred to by the generic names protan, deutan, and tirtan, to distinguish disorders in the L-, m-, and S-cone pigments respectively [1]. In other words, Inside the first type of color blindness are three more types of colorblindness which are the most common among individuals. These various types of pigment disorders are relative to the colors that can be impaired or mistaken for other colors. For example, the author explains how the different types of cone pigment deficiencies affect colors “Those inherited alterations resulting in the loss of two cone pigments are referred to as ‘cone monochromacies’ (pitt, 1944; Weale, 1953). They include blue or S-cone monochromacy (affecting both the L- and M-cone ospin genes), green or M-cone monochromacy (affecting the S- and L-cone ospin genes), and red or L-cone monochromacy (affecting the S- and M-cone ospin gens) [1]. These various alterations of the cone pigments cause the person to mix colors up or not see them at all. The colorblindness I have causes me to mix blues and purples, and reds and greens. Using the quote above I’m sure I have a combination of the above traits. The article continues saying that some types of colorblindness are not inherited and are caused by mutations within the genes. I know my grandpa is color blind so I doubt I have a mutation that has made me colorblind. Back on the note of my colorblindness the article talks about tests that can be used to detect what type of colorblindness you have. Sharp elaborates that these tests that “… exploit the color deficits of the color blind, have been designed to screen for protan and deutan defects” [1]. Interestingly enough I can take a test that will tell me what type of colorblindness I have been experiencing.  Before taking a test, I would already know from experience that I mix my greens and reds. Which is common.</p>
	<p>According to [1] the type of colorblindness correlates to the ethnicity of the person. The article by sharp [1] has two tables, one which states that people of European descent are more likely to be red-green colorblind. The other says that males are more likely to be red-green colorblind. Unsurprisingly, I am of European decent and a male which basically clarifies that I am a usual case of colorblindness. Details regarding red-green and other types of colorblindness is stated clearly by authors from my second source whom explain that among the three primary colors humans use proportions of the three primary colors to identify specific colors. “Most humans agree on the proportions of the three primaries required to match a given color. Among those who differ from color normal with respect to the proportions of the primaries, some require that the three be present in unusual proportions and others require only two primaries” [2].  This information makes me think that the deficiency of a color cone pigment (one of the primary colors) causes the body to reprogram to make the most of a lost pigment, an interesting thought. My second source also states that they conducted research and direct tests to determine the percent of color variation among males. “Our strategy has been to isolate these genes as recombinant DNA molecules and compare their structures among normal and mutant individuals” [2].  Using this strategy, the authors have found a percent variation among males. “Moreover, the incidence of red and green color vision variation is quite high—approximately 8 percent among males” [2]. This is a little confusing but I think they mean that among the colorblind people they tested the differences are within an 8% range. This means that most colorblind males only have a slightly different colorblind variation, so the odds that my colorblindness is not the same as my relatives are 8%.</p>
	<p>So, what’s the difference between me and my relatives? According to my second source the red and green pigment genes are extraordinarily similar which might cause the slight variation between individuals. “We showed that the red and green pigment genes were extraordinarily similar in DNA sequence (98 percent identity)” [2]. Having such a high similarity might be causing the slight variation of red-green colorblindness. From the research articles that I have read and used for my research I have answered most of my questions about colorblindness. It is much more confusing than I thought it would be, yet I believe I have an understanding of how colorblindness works. From my research, as far as I know, colorblindness starts in the genes of an individual which alters the cone pigments within the eye which causes the individual to see colors differently than others. Some cases are more severe but all of the different types of cases can be observed and identified through scientific analysis.</p>

<h>Conclusion</h>
</div>
	<p>For me, this has been a very interesting topic to research. Because I am affected by the very thing I have been researching. Understanding why I am colorblind and why I confuse certain colors has always been in the back of my mind but I have never spent the time and effort to fully understand how it works. Thanks to this research paper I can finally check “why am I colorblind” off my list. So, was I surprised at what I found? Yes and no. For example, no I always thought that it was genetics because my grandpa and cousin are both colorblind. And yes, I was surprised that it is so complex and scientific to the extent that thousands of hours of research have led scientists to a complete understanding of the slightest differences and multiple types of colorblindness. It’s amazing to me that so many people are obsessed with the desire to understand colorblindness to the extent that they have gone to.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to answer all of my questions about colorblindness and I think this was due to the type of research people publish about colorblindness. Most of the articles I found were extremely scientific and solely focused on the scientific aspects of colorblindness. This was also beneficial to my research because I am a scientific person so I was able to become fully interested in the topic, therefore; I enjoyed the research I found and conducted. Now, if someone asks me about my colorblindness I can explain the various scientific details about the genes, types of colorblindness, and variations between individuals. Overall, I am happy with the research I found and conducted because now I understand colorblindness as much as I hoped I would in the past.</p>
